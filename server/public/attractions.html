                <h2>Golden Gate Park</h2>
                <p>Golden Gate Park is an urban park between the Richmond and Sunset districts of San Francisco, California, United States. 
                    It is the largest park in the city, containing 1,017 acres, and the third-most visited urban park in the United States, 
                    with an estimated 24 million visitors annually. Much as San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge was deemed "The Bridge That Couldn't 
                    Be Built", the 1,000+ acres of terrain once known as the "Outside Lands" wasn't a promising sight for a park. In 1871, 
                    field engineer William Hammond Hill and master gardener John McLaren carved out an urban oasis later named Golden Gate Park.
                    Today, the park is home to some of San Francisco's most-visited attractions, including the Japanese Tea Garden, the San Francisco 
                    Botanical Garden, the de Young Museum, and the California Academy of Sciences. Golden Gate Park sees more than 24 million visitors annually, 
                    making it the third most-visited city park in the United States.</p>

                <h2>Alcatraz Island</h2>
                <p>The name Alcatraz is derived from the Spanish "Alcatraces." In 1775, the Spanish explorer Juan Manuel de Ayala was the first to sail into what is now known as San Francisco Bay - 
                    his expedition mapped the bay and named one of the three islands Alcatraces. Over time, the name was Anglicized to Alcatraz. While the exact meaning is still debated, Alcatraz is 
                    usually defined as meaning "pelican" or "strange bird." In 1850, a presidential order set aside the island for possible use as a United States military reservation. The California Gold Rush, 
                    the resulting boom in the growth of San Francisco, and the need to protect San Francisco Bay led the U.S. Army to build a Citadel, or fortress, at the top of the island in the early 1850s. 
                    The Army also made plans to install more than 100 cannons on the island, making Alcatraz the most heavily fortified military site on the West Coast. Together with Fort Point and Lime Point, 
                    Alcatraz formed a "triangle of defense" designed to protect the entrance to the bay. The island was also the site of the first operational lighthouse on the West Coast of the United States.</p>
